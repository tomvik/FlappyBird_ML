The goal of the project is to have a functional (low budget) flappy bird game and then train some birds with ML:
Neural network and best survivors will pass on their "genes"
Neural Network:
    Inputs:
        1. Vertical distance from midpoint of next window
        2. Horizontal distance from midpoint of next window
    Outputs:
        1. Flap or not to Flap
    3 layer NN, hidden layer of n Nodes
Best survivor:
    Distance traveled from the beginning

TODO:
-Add restart option
-Add inputs of distance
-Add the ML part
